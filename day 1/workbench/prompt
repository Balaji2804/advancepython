I am using a custom ai extension which is useful for creating custom prompts. I want to automate some of the devops stuff like executing terraform and concourse scripts. I developed a simple web app which will download the standard code i.e. cookiecutter template into our local machine. I'm also planning to provide architecture diagram for terraform code. I also developed a web app called concourse builder which allows the user to design the pipeline and allows the user to enter the necessary parameters for each component on double-clicking that component. It will store all the parameters in json format and convert it into .yaml format by using gpt model. Then it allow to create a pipeline in concourse from that app itself. Now I want you to provide a clear on how I can integrate that custom ai extension in such a way that include all the above features.
